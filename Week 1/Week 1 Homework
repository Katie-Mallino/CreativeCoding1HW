CLIs and GUIs are both tools that allow people to interact with a computer system. There are many different ways to use both tools to allow users to control their desired systems. The differences lie in the structure of these tools. CLIs are text-based tools that allow people to manually type commands into a terminal, and then the computer interprets and runs said commands. GUIs are an interface that allows people to use visual elements to tell the computer what commands to run. These visual features can include things like menus, buttons, icons, etc, and are operated using a mouse or touch screen as opposed to text input by a keyboard. GUIs, through their visual elements, make it easier to perform actions on a computer as opposed to CLIs making GUIs a little more user-friendly. GUIs separate the user from the computer function, making for a more intuitive experience. Whereas CLIs are more like the behind-the-scenes instructions for computers that users can input themselves. For example, CLIs can be used for developing software, system administration, and automation. Those who are more advanced computer users have an easier time using CLIs and sometimes prefer it over GUIs.
